/// that there is one-to-one mapping from DA cert to the value.
/// It is possible that the same DA certs are populated twice especially
/// batcher is misbehaving. The data structures preserve this information.
///
/// Two actors populates EigenDAWitness. One is the
/// OracleEigenDAPreimageProvider which takes preimage data from the
/// EigenDAPreimageProvider during the first run of the
/// derivation pipeline. OracleEigenDAPreimageProvider wraps around an
/// implementaion of EigenDAPreimageProvider trait to populate encoded_payloads and recencies.
///
/// The remaining validity part is populated by a separator actor, usually in the
/// zkVM host, which requests zk prover for generating zk validity proof.
/// Although it is possible to move this logics into OracleEigenDAPreimageProvider,
/// we can lose the benefit of proving aggregation. Moreover, it is up to
/// the zkVM host to choose its the proving backend. Baking validity generation
/// into the OracleEigenDAPreimageProvider is less ideal.
///
/// After witness is populated, PreloadedEigenDAPreimageProvider takes witness
/// and verify their correctness
///
/// It is important to note that the length of recencies, validities and encoded_payloads
/// might differ when there is stale cert, or a certificate is invalid
/// validities.len() >= encoded_payloads.len(), as there are layers of
/// filtering.
/// The vec data struct does not maintain the information about which cert
/// is filtered at which layer. As it does not matter, since the data will
/// be verified in the PreloadedEigenDAPreimageProvider. And when the derivation
/// pipeline calls for a preimage for a DA cert, the two DA certs must
/// match, and otherwise there is failures. See PreloadedEigenDAPreimageProvider
